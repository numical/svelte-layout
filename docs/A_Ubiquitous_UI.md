#A Ubiquitous UI ..?
`yoo͞-bĭk′wĭ-tas: _Being or existing everywhere_`  
What's involved in creating one?

## Why?
* the established trinity of Web, Android & iOS is daft
  * (but it's actually not Steve Jobs' fault)
* what about all the [others...](./devices.gif)?
  * 'peak smartphone'..?
  * IoT
* don't conflate Javascript with Web (which is Javascript on the DOM)
* options:
 * hybrid - Electron / Phone Gap / Cordova etc.
 * 'virtual DOM's' - React / Rect Native / Reactt for Windows!
 * maybe java led the way wit Java ME, Java SE, Java EE
 
 
 ## What
 * UUI
 * application posture? **sovereign** (transient,daemonic, auxiliary)
 * fully responsive, any [form factor](./form_factors.gif)
 * single page app => single page UI
 * progressive disclosure
 * discoverable
   * 'intuitive' === familiarity
* offer and accept __any__ available input
 
 
 ## How
 * svelte plus experimentaton!
